/**
 * The first-party `preview` module (the LAST roadmap slice — live role-preview, charter-bounded by C020).
 *
 * It is a mergeable contract FRAGMENT that adds ONE operation — `GET preview/login?role=…` — the deploy's own
 * role-login route. The extension never mints or holds a session: it deep-links this route in the system
 * browser (vscode.env.openExternal), and the credentialed act happens server-side, inside the generated
 * PREVIEW Worker's Better Auth, behind a fail-closed gate (env.SULUK_PREVIEW === "1" AND a PREVIEW_DB binding;
 * see @suluk/better-auth previewLoginHandler). The op carries `x-suluk-preview-only: true` so converge WARNs if
 * this backdoor ever shows up in a contract — it must only be reachable in a preview deployment.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY: no security scheme. The gate is a DEPLOY-TIME runtime flag, not a credential the client sends —
 * modelling `role` as an apiKey would misrepresent the op as authenticating when it merely SELECTS a seeded
 * demo identity behind a server gate. The op is public at the contract level + honestly marked preview-only.
 *
 * It REQUIRES the host's User (so a composition that has auth knows the roles), PROVIDES no entity, and is
 * EXCLUDED from FIRST_PARTY_REGISTRY.modules and every stack template (see ./index.ts): a session-establishing
 * module must never be marketplace/compose-installable — that is the textbook supply-chain credential hole. It
 * is a deploy-flavor fragment, installed deliberately, not browsed.
