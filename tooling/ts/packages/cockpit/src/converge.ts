/**
 * Contract converge — a coherence audit over a WHOLE contract (the burhan-converge spirit). installModule

 * that isn't defined, a $ref to a schema nothing provides, a path with no operations, an entity referenced by
 * nothing. Run it after composing modules to know the merged platform is self-consistent, not just collision-free.
 * Pure (no host) → unit-tested.
