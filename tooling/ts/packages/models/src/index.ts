/**
 * `@suluk/models` — a weekly, PUBLIC-DATA-ONLY OpenRouter model catalog + a selector. A suluk skill declares NEEDS
 * (hard filters) + a small PREFERENCE (a named profile), and selectModel picks the best CURRENT model — never a
 * hard-coded id. Decidable OpenRouter facts are numbers; noisy benchmarks are coarse TIERS with {source, asOf};
 * UNKNOWN is honest (never imputed to worst); no cross-axis composite is stored (blending is the selector's job).
 * Council wf_729cde52-cc7. CANDIDATE tooling — NOT official OAS. The live weekly fetcher is specified in REFRESH.md
 * (this package ships the schema + selector + a SEED catalog; the 200-row generated catalog is the data-eng spine).
