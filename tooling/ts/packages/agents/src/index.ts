/**
 * @suluk/agents — the Suluk Agent composition layer (C027). Lint + project an `x-suluk-agents` map (skills +
 * deterministic routes + by-name sub-agents) into a Claude plugin AND an OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible manifest:
 * one contract, two artifacts, zero network at generate time. This package is the OTHER side of the D1 wall —
 * it reads `x-suluk-agents`, which @suluk/core's matcher (buildAda/matchRequest) provably never does. Selection
 * and tiering are runtime-advisory; determinism is DECLARED, never enforced. CANDIDATE tooling — NOT official OAS.
 *
 * NB (the C027 module-boundary invariant): @suluk/core MUST NEVER import @suluk/agents. The dependency is one-way.
 * test/core-boundary.test.ts enforces it as a maintained tripwire.
