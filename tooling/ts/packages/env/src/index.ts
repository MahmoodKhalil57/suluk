/**
 * `@suluk/env` — config + secrets as a single source of truth, made post-quantum-safe.
 *
 * Declare each variable ONCE with defineEnv (typed, per-surface, secret-aware); encrypt secret VALUES with
 * ML-KEM-768 + AES-256-GCM so the .env is safe to commit to git and share over public channels; and project the
 * one declaration into every surface — local, Cloudflare, preview, a teammate's machine, the VS Code extension,
 * the admin panel. dotenvx's commit-safely model, quantum-safe, Suluk-native.
 *
 * This entry is RUNTIME-AGNOSTIC (Web Crypto + @noble/post-quantum only — no node:fs), so it imports cleanly in
 * a Cloudflare Worker. Filesystem helpers + the CLI live in `@suluk/env/node`.
