/**
 * @suluk/cloudflare — API-driven provisioning + deployment for a Suluk app on Cloudflare, no wrangler CLI. A typed
 * REST client, idempotent provisioners (D1 / KV / R2 / secrets), the Workers module-script + static-assets upload
 * flow, and a one-call `deploy()` that wires them in dependency order. The platform that ships itself, shipping
 * itself — readable, testable, and the same contract-first discipline as the rest of the suite. CANDIDATE tooling.
