/**
 * @suluk/cost — cost as a contract facet + runtime metering. You can't price a user without knowing what
 * they cost you. So: declare per-operation cost (incl. third-party usage) on the contract — it bubbles into
 * the v4 doc, Scalar, and the audit; meter the ACTUAL cost per request at runtime, traced from the frontend
 * action down to each third party; and read the raw per-user picture from the ledger. We display the data as
 * it is and let you build pricing on top (Stripe via @suluk/stripe). CANDIDATE tooling — NOT official OAS.
